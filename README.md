# Title H1 Remix Classic Tracks
## Introduction - Harry Potter and the Swan
This is a mix of the classic Harry Potter theme song and the piano Swan Lake, both of which have a soft rhythm as the key, and I added the drum to increase the rhythm of the song as if Harry Potter meets a group of cygnets.

Technologies
Remix using Python language, combined with TUnePad website technology.

Launch
This track does not require any hardware, I used TunePad website for mixing, using the basic Python language. The song is only 45 seconds long, but long enough to show the rhythmic collision of the two songs, as well as the story
